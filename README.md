# Space X Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction | IBM-DATA-SCIENCE|

* The goal of this project was to predict whether or not SpaceX's Falcon 9 First Stage would land based on its relevant features.
* EDA, data pre-processing, data visualization, modeling, and evaluation were performed.
* As learning algorithms, KNN, SVM, Decision tree and Logistic regression are used.
* The obtained performances for all models are summarized in below table.
 
   | Classifier | Mean accuracy |
   |----|----|
   |Logistic regression | 0.833|
   |SVM |0.833| 
   |Decision Tree Classifier |0.833|
   |KNN Classifier |0.778|
